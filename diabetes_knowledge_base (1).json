Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic disorders of carbohydrate metabolism in which glucose is both underutilized as an energy source and overproduced due to in- appropriate gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, resulting in hyperglycemia (1). Diabe- tes can be diagnosed by demonstrating increased concentrations of glucose in venous plasma or increased A1C in the blood. Diabetes is classified conventionally into several clinical categories (e. g., type or type diabetes, gestational diabetes mellitus, and other specific types derived from other causes, such as genetic causes, exocrine pan- creaticdisorders,andmedications)(2). DIAGNOSTIC TESTS FOR DIABETES Recommendations 2.1a Diagnose diabetes based on A1C or plasma glucose criteria, either the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) value, 2 - h plasma glucose (2 - h PG) value during a 75 - g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or random glucose value accompanied by classic hy- *A complete list of members of the American perglycemicsymptoms/crisescriteria(Table2.1).

Building positive health behaviors and maintaining psychological well - being are foun- dational for achieving diabetes management goals and maximizing quality of life (1,2). Essential to achieving these goals are diabetes self - management education and support (DSMES), medical nutrition therapy (MNT), routine physical activity, counsel- ing and treatment to support cessation of tobacco products and vaping, health be- havior counseling, and psychosocial care.

ASSESSMENT OF GLYCEMIC STATUS Glycemic status is assessed by A1C measurement, blood glucose monitoring (BGM) by capillary (finger - stick) devices, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) using time in range (TIR) or mean CGM glucose. Clinical trials of interventions that lower A1C have demonstrated the benefits of improved glycemia. Glucose monitoring via CGM or BGM (discussed in detail in Section 7, “Diabetes Technology”) is useful for di- abetes self - management, can provide nuanced information on glucose responses to meals, physical activity, and medication changes, and may be particularly useful in in- dividuals taking insulin. CGM serves an increasingly important role in optimizing the effectiveness and safety of treatment in many people with type diabetes and in se- lected people with type diabetes or other forms of diabetes (e. g., cystic fibrosis–related diabetes). Individuals on a variety of insulin treatment plans can benefit from CGM with improved glucose levels, decreased hypoglycemia, and enhanced self - efficacy (Section 7, “Diabetes Technology”) (1). *A complete list of members of the American Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committeecanbefoundathttps://doi. org/10.2337/ dc24 - SINT.

Diabetes technology is the term used to describe the hardware, devices, and soft- ware that people with diabetes use to assist with self - management, ranging from lifestyle modifications to glucose monitoring and therapy adjustments. Historically, diabetestechnology has been divided into two main categories: insulin administered bysyringe, pen, patch devices, or pump(also called continuous subcutaneousinsulin infusion [CSII]) and glucose as assessed by blood glucose monitoring (BGM) or con- tinuousglucose monitoring (CGM). Diabetes technology has expanded toinclude au- tomated insulin delivery (AID) systems, where CGM - informed algorithms modulate insulindelivery,connectedinsulinpens,aswellasdiabetesself - managementsupport software servingasmedical devices. Diabetestechnology, when coupled with educa- tion, follow - up, and support, can improve the lives and health of people with diabe- tes; however, the complexity and rapid evolution of the diabetes technology landscape can also be a barrier to implementation for people with diabetes, their carepartners, and thehealthcareteam.

Obesity and Weight Management American Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee* for the Prevention and Treatment of Type Diabetes: Standards of – Carein Diabetes Diabetes Care 2024;47(Suppl. 1):S145–S157 | https://doi. org/10.2337/dc24 - S008 The American Diabetes Association (ADA) “Standards of Care in Diabetes” includes the ADA’s current clinical practice recommendations and is intended to provide the components of diabetes care, general treatment goals and guide- lines, and tools to evaluate quality of care. Members of the ADA Professional Practice Committee, an interprofessional expert committee, are responsible for updating the Standards of Care annually, or more frequently as warranted. For a detailed description of ADA standards, statements, and reports, as well as the evidence - grading system for ADA’s clinical practice recommendations and a full list of Professional Practice Committee members, please refer to Introduction and Methodology. Readers who wish to comment on the Standards of Care are invited to do so at professional. diabetes. org/SOC. Obesity is a chronic, often relapsing disease with numerous metabolic, physical, and psychosocial complications, including a substantially increased risk for type diabetes (1). There is strong and consistent evidence that obesity management can delay the progression from prediabetes to type diabetes (2–6) and is highly beneficial in treat- ing type diabetes (7–17). In people with type diabetes and overweight or obesity, modest weight loss improves glycemia and reduces the need for glucose - lowering medications (7–9), and larger weight loss substantially",

Consider insulin as the first injectable if evidence of ongoing catabolism is present, symptoms of hyperglycemia are present, when A1C or blood glucose levels are very high (i. e., A1C >10% [>86 mmol/mol] or blood glucose ≥300 mg/d L [≥16.7 mmol/L]), or when a diagnosis of type diabetes is a possibility. 2. When selecting GLP - 1 RAs, consider individual preference, A1C lowering, weight - lowering effect, or frequency of injection. If CVO is present. consider GLP - 1 RA with proven CVO benefit. Oral or injectable GLP - 1 RAs are appropriate. 3. For people on GLP - 1 RA and basal Insulin combination, consider use of a flxed - ratio combination product (IDeg Lira or i Glar Lixi). 4. Consider switching from evening NPH to a basal analog if the individual develops hypoglycemia and/or frequently forgets to administer NPH in the evening and would be better managed wtth an A. M. dose of a long - acting basal Insulin. 5. If adding prandial insulin to NPH, consider initiation of a self - mixed or premixed insulin plan to decrease the number of injections required.

For prevention and management of diabetes complications in children and adoles- cents, please refer to Section 14, “Children and Adolescents.” Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)—defined as coronary heart disease (CHD), cerebrovascular disease, or peripheral artery disease (PAD) presumed to be of atherosclerotic origin—is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality for individuals with diabetes and results in an estimated $39.4 billion in cardiovascular - related spend- ing per year associated with diabetes (1). Common conditions coexisting with type diabetes (e. g., hypertension and dyslipidemia) are clear risk factors for ASCVD, and dia- betes itself confers independent risk. Numerous studies have shown the efficacy of controlling individual cardiovascular risk factors in preventing or slowing ASCVD in peo- ple with diabetes. Furthermore, large benefits are seen when multiple cardiovascular risk factors (glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid control) are addressed simultaneously, *A complete list of members of the American with evidence for legacy benefits (2–4).

    "text": "The risk for left ventricular sys- tolic dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, or heart failure was significantly reduced in the BNP - guided intervention group. Ap- proximately 18% of people in the control and intervention groups had a diagnosis of diabetes. Finally, in the original Intensi- fied Multifactorial Intervention in Pa- tients With Type Diabetes and Microalbuminuria (Steno - 2) trial, in- dividuals with type diabetes and mi- croalbuminuria were enrolled, and the trial examined the effect of multifacto- rial treatment on cardiovascular out- comes (219). When stratified in a later analysis by NT - pro BNP levels, plasma NT - pro BNP levels above the median were associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and a decrease in plasma NT - pro BNP of pg/m L for the first years of intervention was associated with a 1% relative risk reduction in the primary cardiovascular end point (220). Based on this collective evidence, the committee recommends considering screen- ing asymptomatic adults with diabetes for the development of cardiac structural or functional abnormalities (stage B heart failure) by measurement of natriuretic peptides, including BNP or NT - pro BNP levels. The biomarker threshold for ab- normal values is a BNP level pg/m L and NT - pro BNP pg/m L. Abnormal levels of natriuretic peptide will need to be evaluated in the context of each indi- vidual, using clinical judgment, and in the absence of any possible competing diag- noses, particularly recognizing conditions that may lead to increased levels of natriuretic peptide, including renal in- sufficiency, pulmonary disease including pulmonary hypertension and chronic ob- structive lung disease, obstructive sleep apnea, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, and anemia. Conversely, natriuretic pep- tide levels may be decreased in the population with obesity, which impairs sensitivity of testing.

There are also differences in recommended care for children and adolescents with type di- abetes, type diabetes, and other forms of pediatric diabetes.

Monogenic diabetes (neonatal diabetes and maturity - onset dia- betes of the young [MODY]) and cystic fibrosis–related diabetes, which are often pre- sent in youth, are discussed in Section 2, “Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes.” Table 14.1A and Table 14.1B provide an overview of the recommendations for screening and treatment of complications and related conditions in pediatric type diabetes and type diabetes, respectively.

S. in parallel with the worldwide epidemic of obesity. Not only is the prevalence of type diabetes and type diabetes increasing in individuals of reproductive age, but there is also a dramatic increase in the reported rates of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Diabe- tes confers significantly greater maternal and fetal risk largely related to the degree of hyperglycemia but also related to chronic complications and comorbidities of diabe- tes. In general, specific risks of diabetes in pregnancy include spontaneous abortion, fetal anomalies, preeclampsia, fetal demise, macrosomia, neonatal hypoglycemia, neo- natal hyperbilirubinemia, and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, among others. In addition, diabetes in pregnancy increases the risks of obesity, hypertension, and type diabetes in offspring later in life (1,2). *A complete list of members of the American Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee Preconception Counseling can be found at https://doi. org/10.2337/dc24 - SINT.

Amonghospitalizedindividuals,hyperglycemia,hypoglycemia,andglucosevariability are associated with adverse outcomes, including increased morbidity and mortality (1). Identification and careful management of people with diabetes and dysglycemia during hospitalization has direct and immediate benefits. Diabetes management in the inpatient setting is facilitated by identification and treatment of hyperglycemia prior to elective procedures, a dedicated inpatientdiabetes management service ap- plying validated standards of care, and a proactive transition plan for outpatient dia- betes care with timely prearranged follow - up appointments.

Members of the ADA Professional Practice Committee, an interprofessional expert committee, are responsible for updating the Standards of Care annually, or more frequently as warranted.

Readers who wish to com- mentonthe Standardsof Careareinvitedtodosoatprofessional. diabetes. org/SOC. Managing the daily health demands of diabetes can be challenging. People living with diabetes should not have to face discrimination due to diabetes. By advocating for the rights of those with diabetes at all levels, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) can help to ensure thatthey live a healthy and productive life. A strategic goal of the ADA is for more children and adultswith diabetes to live free from the burden ofdiscrimination. The ADA is also focused on making sure cost is nota barrier tosuc- cessfuldiabetesmanagement. One tactic for achieving these goals has been to implement the ADA Standards of Care through advocacy - oriented position statements. The ADA publishes evidence- based, peer - reviewed statements on topics such as diabetes and employment, diabe- tes and driving, insulin access and affordability, and diabetes management in certain settings such as schools,childcare programs, and detention facilities. In addition to the ADA’s clinical documents, these advocacy statements are important tools in educating schools, employers, licensing agencies, policy makers, and others about the intersec- tion of diabetes management and the law and for providing scientifically supported policyrecommendations. *A complete list of members of the American ADVOCACY STATEMENTS Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee The following is a partial list of advocacy statements ordered by publication date, with can be found at https://doi. org/10.2337/dc24 - SINT. the most recent statement appearing first.
